# Minimal New Tab Extension

I really don't like google doodles on my newtab pages. Unfortunatly due to some chrome premission settings the chrome://newtab page is unable to be hooked. And thus we can't just block doodle requests.

## WIP

Not ready for release. Only BRAVE adventurers allowed.

## License

TBD
